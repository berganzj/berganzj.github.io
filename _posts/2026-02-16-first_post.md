#First impressions

I'm very interested with the first few chapters.  My python isn't strong enough to fully follow.  I will work on Python coding practice.

The unique way of learning through experminentation intrigues me.  I was never built for the classroom.

It's still far fetched (to me) that a neural network of multiplications and additions can generate these results.  Hopefully the chapters outside the introduction clarify.
